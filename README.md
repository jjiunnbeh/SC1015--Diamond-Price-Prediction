# SC1015 Mini Project : Predicting the price of diamond

## Predicitng Price of Diamond prices for general public looking to buy diamonds ## 
In general, people have limited knowledge about the prices of diamonds and diamond sellers capitalize on this by selling diamonds with unfair prices. 
So , we are going to try to predict the prices of diamonds based on the 4Cs(colour, clarity , cut , carat) , so that people can have a better understanding on
the prices of diamonds and check if they are being sold to them at a fair price.


## The available features are: ##

 price : USD price

 carat : weight of the diamond --> 1 carat equals 0.2 grams

 cut  : quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

 color  : diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity  : measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

 depth : measure of the depth in relation to the width of the diamondâ€™s table, calculated as --> Depth (%) = Depth (mm) / Diameter (mm)

 table  : top facet of the stone; table percentage is the ratio between the table size and the diameter of the diamond

 x  : length in mm

 y  : width in mm

 z  : depth in mm
